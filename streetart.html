This mural was drawn by the famous artist Banksy he drew this to pay tribute to jailed turkish artist Zehra Dogan he drew this to protest over the imprisonment of Zehra Dogan because she's a journalist and a artist and she was serving jail time for three years because one of her paintings she did. Zehra Dogan got arrested because she posted a watercolor showing the rubble of the Kurdish town on Nusaybin destroyed by the turkish army in 2015. The reason Banksy drew this mural was because he feel for Zehra because he feels like he has drawn worse stuff then what she did and it's not fair that she got arrested.</p>

This drawing in dumbo with a superhero and a quote that says "The society that separates its scholars from its warriors will have its thinking done by cowards and its fighting by fools." has many different interpretations one of those interpretations is that if a man doesn't appreciate the importance of knowledge and strength, he is condemed to be a coward or a fool. Another interpretation is the standard of justice depends on the equality of power to compel it. A lot of art has different interpretations that people have and this is one of them. </p>
